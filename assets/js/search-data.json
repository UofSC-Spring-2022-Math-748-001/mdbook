    "content": "Let $R$ be a $\\mathbb{N}$-graded commutative ring. We constructed a functor \\(\\widetilde{(-)} : \\operatorname{GrMod} R \\to \\operatorname{Mod} X\\) where $X = \\operatorname{Proj} R$ and a functor in the other direction \\(\\begin{aligned} \\underline{\\Gamma}(X,-) : \\operatorname{Mod} X &amp; \\to \\operatorname{GrMod} R \\\\ \\mathcal F &amp; \\mapsto \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\Gamma(X,\\mathcal F(i)) \\end{aligned}\\) . Let’s think a little more about their relationsip. For any $m \\in M_l$, we get a map \\(\\begin{aligned} m : R &amp; \\to M(l) \\\\ r &amp; \\mapsto rm \\end{aligned}\\) Applying $\\widetilde{(-)}$, we get a map \\(\\mathcal O_X \\to \\widetilde{M}(l)\\) and hence an element of $\\Gamma(X,\\widetilde{M}(l))$. This gives a natural transformation \\(\\eta_M : M \\to \\underline{\\Gamma}(X,\\widetilde{M})\\) . Similarly, for any $\\mathcal O_X$-module $\\mathcal F$, there is a natural transformation \\(\\epsilon_{\\mathcal F} : \\widetilde{\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)} \\to \\mathcal F\\) which we describe on the principal opens $U_x$ for $x \\in R_i$ with $i &gt; 0$. We have \\(\\widetilde{\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)}(U_x) = (\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)_x)_0\\) Each element of $(\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)_x)_0$ can be written as \\(\\frac{f}{x^s}\\) where $f \\in \\Gamma(X, \\mathcal F(si))$ and $x \\in R_i$. Restricting to $U_x$ we get an element $f|_{U_x} \\in \\Gamma(U_x,\\mathcal F(si))$. On $U_x$, we have an isomorphism $1/x^s : \\mathcal F(is) \\to \\mathcal F$. Thus, we get an element \\(\\frac{1}{x^s} f|_{U_x} \\in \\Gamma(U_x,\\mathcal F)\\) giving an element of $\\mathcal F(U_x)$. Proposition. The natural transformations $\\eta$ and $\\epsilon$ induce an adjunction $\\widetilde{(-)} \\dashv \\underline{\\Gamma}$. Proof. (Expand to view) Using a theorem from last semester, we have to check that \\(\\widetilde{M} \\overset{\\widetilde{\\eta_M}}{\\to} \\widetilde{ \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{M})} \\overset{\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{M}}}{\\to} \\widetilde{M}\\) and \\(\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F) \\overset{\\eta_{\\underline{\\Gamma} (\\mathcal F)}}{\\to} \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{\\underline{ \\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)}) \\overset{\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\epsilon_{\\mathcal F})}{\\to} \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)\\) are both identity maps. For the $\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{M}} \\circ \\widetilde{\\eta_M}$, we check the map is the identity for sections over each principal open $U_x$. Given $m/x^i \\in \\widetilde{M}(U_x)$, we have \\(\\widetilde{\\eta_M}(m/x^i) = \\frac{\\eta_M(m)}{x^i}\\) restricting $\\eta_M(m)$ back to $U_x$ gives $m \\in \\Gamma(U_x, \\widetilde{M}(|m|))$. For $\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\epsilon_{\\mathcal F}) \\circ \\eta_{\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)}$, if we take $f \\in \\Gamma(X,\\mathcal F(l))$, then \\(\\eta_{\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)}(f) : \\mathcal O \\to \\widetilde{\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)}(l)\\) corresponds to global section $\\widetilde{\\underline{\\Gamma} (\\mathcal F)}(l)$ of which is $f$ on each $U_x$. Applying $\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\epsilon_{\\mathcal F})$, we see we get $f$ back. &#9632; &nbsp; Under some mild assumptions, we see that $\\widetilde{(-)}$ hits all quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$. Lemma. If $R$ is finitely-generated in degree $1$ as a graded $k$-algebra and $\\mathcal F$ is quasi-coherent, then $\\epsilon_{\\mathcal F}$ is an isomorphism. Proof. (Expand to view) From the above, we see that $\\eta_{\\mathcal F}(f/x^s) = 0$ if and only if $f|_{U_x} = 0$. Thus, $f = 0$ away from $Z(x)$. Let $x_0,\\ldots,x_n$ denote our generators in degree $1$. We have a affine cover $U_{x_j}$ and \\(Z(x) \\cap U_{x_j} = Z(x/x_j^i)\\) is a hypersurface in each $U_j$. Then $M := \\Gamma(U_{x_j},\\mathcal F(is))$ is a $R := (R_{x_j})_0$ module and $f \\in M$. We know that $f = 0$ in $M_{x/x_j^i}$ so there is some $n_j$ with \\(\\frac{x^{n_j}}{x_j^{n_j i}} f = 0\\) on $U_{x_j}$. Taking the max of the $n_j$, we see that there is some $x$ with $x^n f = 0$ on all of $X$. Thus, $f = 0$ in $\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\mathcal F)_x$ already and $\\epsilon_{\\mathcal F}$ is injective. A similar argument shows that for any $s \\in \\Gamma(U_x,\\mathcal F)$ there is some $n &gt; 0$ so that $x^n s$ lifts to $\\Gamma(X,\\mathcal F(ni)$. This shows that $\\epsilon_{\\mathcal F}$ is surjective. &#9632; &nbsp; Recall that for a graded $R$-module $M$, we have its torsion submodule \\(\\tau(M) := \\lbrace m \\in M \\mid \\exists ~n_0 &gt; 0, (R_+)^n m = 0 ~\\forall n \\geq n_0 \\rbrace\\) and we say a $M$ is torsion if \\(\\tau(M) = M\\) The module is torsion-free if \\(\\tau(M) = 0\\) . There is a short exact sequence \\(0 \\to \\tau(M) \\to M \\to M/\\tau(M) \\to 0\\) Since \\(\\widetilde{\\tau(M)} = 0\\) there is a natural map \\(\\alpha_M : M/\\tau(M) \\to \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{M})\\) . Lemma. Assume $R$ is finitely-generated over $k$ in degree $1$ by $x_0,\\ldots,x_n$ and that each $x_i$ is not a zero-divisor. Then $\\alpha_M$ is injective . Proof. (Expand to view) The kernel of $M \\to \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{M})$ consists of $m \\in M$ such that $(m) = 0$ in $(M_x)_0$ for all homogeneous $x \\in R_+$. Let $x_0,\\ldots,x_n$ denote the generators of $R$ over $k$ in degree $1$. Let $m \\in \\operatorname{ker} \\alpha_M$ be an element of degree $l$. Then $m/x_i^l = 0$ for each $i$ and $x_i^{n_i}m = 0$ for some $n_i$. Thus, for large enough $n$ we have $(R_+)^n m = 0$ and so $m \\in \\operatorname{Tors}(M)$. &#9632; &nbsp; We can describe $\\tau(M)$ as \\(\\tau(M) \\cong \\operatorname{colim}_s \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}(R/(R_+)^s,M)\\) where \\(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}(M,N) := \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\operatorname{Hom}(M,N(i))\\) is the internal Hom for graded modules. There are also the exact sequences \\(0 \\to (R_+)^s \\to R \\to R/(R_+)^s\\) which gives an exact sequence \\(0 \\to \\operatorname{colim}_s \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}(R/(R_+)^s,M) \\to M \\to \\operatorname{colim}_s \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}((R_+)^s,M)\\) similar to the sequence \\(0 \\to \\tau(M) \\to M \\to \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{M})\\) which leads us to compare $\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{M})$ and $\\operatorname{colim}_s \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}((R_+)^s,M)$ . Since \\(\\cdots \\to \\widetilde{(R_+)^{s+1}} \\to \\widetilde{(R_+)^s} \\to \\cdots \\to \\widetilde{R_+} \\to \\widetilde{R}\\) are all isomorphisms, we see that any \\(\\phi \\in \\operatorname{colim} \\operatorname{Hom} ((R_+)^s,M(l))\\) induces a well-defined \\(\\widetilde{\\phi} : \\mathcal O \\to \\widetilde{M}(l)\\) and hence an element of $\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{M})$. Let’s denote this map by \\(\\beta_M : \\operatorname{colim}_s \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}((R_+)^s,M) \\to \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{M})\\) . Lemma. Assume that $R$ is finitely-generated over $k$ by elements of degree $1$. Then $\\beta_M$ is an isomorphism for all $M$. Proof. (Expand to view) An element of $\\Gamma(X,\\widetilde{M}(l))$ is a collection of homogeneous elements $m_f \\in M$ for each homogeneous $f \\in R_+$ so that . | there is $s_f$ such that $m_f/f^{s_f}$ has degree $l$ and | for any $f,g$ \\(\\frac{m_f}{f^{s_f}} = \\frac{m_g}{g^{s_g}}\\) in $M_{fg}$. | . Let $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ denote a set of homogeneous generators for $R$ over $k$. We claim that the function $\\phi$ which assigns $\\phi(x_i^{s_i}) = m_{x_i}$ extends to a well-defined module map $(R_+)^s \\to M(l)$ for some $s$. This gives the inverse to $\\beta_M$. Let’s check that this construction yields a well-defined homomorphism. Up to replacing $m_i$ with $x_i^{l_i}$ and $s_i$ with $s_i+l_i$, we can assume that \\(m_i = \\frac{x_i^{s_i}}{x_j^{s_j}}m_j\\) in $M_{x_j}$. If we have a relation of the form \\(a_1x_1^{s_1} + \\cdots + a_n x_n^{s_n} = 0\\) then in $M_{x_i}$ we have \\(\\begin{aligned} a_1 m_1 + \\cdots a_n m_n &amp; = a_1 \\frac{x_1^{s_1}}{x_i^{s_i}}m_i + \\cdots + a_n \\frac{x_1^{s_1}}{x_i^{s_i}}m_i \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{m_i}{x_i^{s_i}} \\left( a_1 x_1^{s_1} + \\cdots + a_n x_n^{s_n} \\right) = 0 \\end{aligned}\\) Thus, $a_1 m_1 + \\cdots + a_n m_n$ is annihilated by some power of each $x_i$. Passing to a sufficient high power of $R_+$ forces this to vanish. &#9632; &nbsp; As a corollary, we get short exact sequences. Corollary. Assume that $R$ is finitely-generated by elements of degree $1$ over $k$. Then, for each injective graded $R$-module $I$ we have a short exact sequence \\(0 \\to \\tau(I) \\to I \\to \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{I}) \\to 0\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Since $I$ is injective, we get short exact sequences \\(0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(R/(R_+)^s,I(l)) \\to I_l \\to \\operatorname{Hom}((R_+)^s,I(l)) \\to 0\\) taking direct sums and passing to the colimit gives the result. &#9632; &nbsp; Note the map $M \\to \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{M})$ is not always onto. Example. Take $k[x]$ with $|x| = 1$. Then, \\(\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{k[x]}) = k[x,x^{-1}]\\) . As consequence, we get a semi-orthogonal decomposition relating graded $R$-modules and quasi-coherent sheaves on $\\operatorname{Proj} R$. Proposition. Assume that $R$ is finitely-generated by elements of degree $1$ over $k$. Then there are semi-orthogonal decompositions \\(D^\\dagger(\\operatorname{GrMod} R) = \\langle D^\\dagger(\\operatorname{GrMod}_{\\operatorname{Tors}} R), D^\\dagger(\\operatorname{Qcoh} \\operatorname{Proj} R) \\rangle\\) where $\\dagger \\in \\lbrace b,+,-,\\emptyset \\rbrace$. Here $\\operatorname{GrMod}_{\\operatorname{Tors}} R$ denotes the abelian subcategory of torsion graded $R$-modules. Proof. (Expand to view) For each complex of injectives $I$, we have a short exact sequence of complexes \\(0 \\to \\tau(I) \\to I \\to \\underline{\\Gamma} (\\widetilde{I}^\\bullet) \\to 0\\) and thus a triangle \\(\\tau(I) \\to I \\to \\underline{\\Gamma} (\\widetilde{I}^\\bullet) \\to \\tau(I)[1]\\) Each component of $\\tau(I)$ is torsion. Thanks to adjunction we have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(\\tau(I),\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{J})) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(\\widetilde{\\tau(I)}, \\widetilde{J}) = 0\\) so we have semi-orthogonality. It remains to check that $\\underline{\\Gamma}$ is fully-faithful and the derived functors of $\\tau$ and $\\underline{\\Gamma}$ preserve cohomological boundedness. Using adjunction, we have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{I}), \\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{J})) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(\\widetilde{I}, \\widetilde{\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{J})})\\) And \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(\\widetilde{I}, \\widetilde{\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{J})}) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(\\widetilde{I}, \\widetilde{J})\\) since \\(\\widetilde{\\underline{\\Gamma}(\\widetilde{J})} \\to \\widetilde{J}\\) is an isomorphism. Finally, from the triangle we see that $\\mathbf{R}^i\\tau = 0$ for $i \\gg 0$ if and only if $\\mathbf{R}^i \\underline{\\Gamma} = 0$ for $i \\gg 0$. We will see next that $\\mathbf{R}^i \\underline{\\Gamma} = 0$ for $i &gt; N$ where $N$ is the number of generators of $R$ over $k$. &#9632; &nbsp; Remark. | One can remove the condition that the finite set of generators of $R$ are of degree $1$ if we work with the quotient stack $[U/\\mathbb{G}_m]$ with the quasi-affine $U = \\operatorname{Spec} R \\setminus \\lbrace R_+ \\rbrace$ instead of $\\operatorname{Proj} R$. | One would like to replace $\\operatorname{GrMod}$ and $\\operatorname{Qcoh}$ with their finite versions $\\operatorname{grmod}$ and $\\operatorname{coh}$. This can be done but one needs to truncate the grading. | . ",

    "content": "We have developed most of the background necessary to describe the derived category $D^b(\\operatorname{coh} \\mathbb{P}_k^n)$ but we require one more important notion. Definition. Let $\\mathcal T$ be a $k$-linear triangulated category. An object $E$ is ($k$-)exceptional if \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(E,E[l]) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; l \\neq 0 \\\\ k\\cdot 1_E &amp; l = 0 \\end{cases}\\) . A sequence of objects $E_1,\\ldots,E_s$ is called an exceptional collection if . | each $E_i$ is exceptional and | \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(E_i,E_j[l]) = 0\\) for all $l$ and $j &lt; i$. | . We say an exceptional colletion is strong if \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(E_i,E_j[l]) = 0\\) for all $l \\neq 0$. An exceptional collection is full if it generates $\\mathcal T$. Assume we have an abelian category $\\mathcal A$ and a full exceptional collection for $D^\\dagger(\\mathcal A)$. Since full exceptional collections generate, we can apply the results from last semester to get an equivalence \\(D(\\mathcal A) \\cong \\operatorname{perf} A\\) where \\(A = \\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{End}\\left( \\bigoplus E_i \\right)\\) . If, in addition, the collection is strong then we can take \\(A = \\operatorname{End}\\left( \\bigoplus E_i \\right)\\) and $D^\\dagger(\\mathcal A)$ is equivalent to the category of perfect complexes of modules over an honest $k$-algebra. This algebra is usually non-commutative. We can now state a fundamental result of Beilinson. Theorem. For any $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the sheaves \\(\\mathcal O(i-n),\\ldots,\\mathcal O(i-1), \\mathcal O(i)\\) form a full strong exceptional collection for $D^b(\\operatorname{coh} \\mathbb{P}^n_k)$. Showing that something is a full (strong) exceptional collection breaks up into two parts: . | a computation to check that vanishing of the appropriate Hom spaces and | a generation check. | . We handle the generation statement now and the cohomology computation after introducing Cech cohomology. Lemma. We have \\(\\mathcal O(j) \\in \\langle \\mathcal O(i-n),\\ldots,\\mathcal O(i-1), \\mathcal O(i) \\rangle_{\\infty}\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) The Koszul complex $K(x_0,\\ldots,x_n)$ yields an exact complex of graded modules \\(0 \\to R(-n-1) \\to \\bigoplus_{i=0}^n R(-n+1) \\to \\cdots \\\\ \\to \\bigoplus_{i=0}^n R(-1) \\to R \\to R/(x_0,\\ldots,x_n) \\to 0\\) Applying $\\widetilde{(-)}$ gives the exact sequence \\(0 \\to \\mathcal O(-n-1) \\to \\bigoplus_{i=0}^n \\mathcal O(-n+1) \\to \\cdots \\\\ \\to \\bigoplus_{i=0}^n \\mathcal O(-1) \\to \\mathcal O \\to 0\\) Twisting by $\\mathcal O(i)$ we get an exact sequence \\(0 \\to \\mathcal O(i-n-1) \\to \\bigoplus_{i=0}^n \\mathcal O(i-n+1) \\to \\cdots \\\\ \\to \\bigoplus_{i=0}^n \\mathcal O(i-1) \\to \\mathcal O(i) \\to 0\\) Consequently, if we have $\\mathcal O(i-n),\\ldots,\\mathcal O(i-1), \\mathcal O(i)$ we can generate both $\\mathcal O(i-n-1)$ and $\\mathcal O(i+1)$. &#9632; &nbsp; Lemma. We have \\(\\mathcal F \\in \\langle \\mathcal O(i-n),\\ldots,\\mathcal O(i-1), \\mathcal O(i) \\rangle_{\\infty}\\) for any coherent sheaf $\\mathcal F$. Proof. (Expand to view) We have $\\mathcal F = \\widetilde{M}$ for a finitely- generated graded module $M$. From the previous lemma and the fact $\\widetilde{(-)}$ is exact, it is enough to show we can generate $M$ from $\\mathcal O(j)$ for $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Inductively, we can construct an exact sequence \\(F^l \\to F^{l+1} \\to \\cdots F^0 \\to M \\to 0\\) with \\(F^i = \\bigoplus_{j = 1}^r R(m_{ij})\\) Since $k[x_0,\\ldots,x_n]$ is regular and graded local, we have the kernel $F^{-n} \\to F^{-n+1}$ is free. Thus, for $j &gt; n+1$, the extension of $M$ by $K^{-j}$ \\(0 \\to K^{-j} \\to F^{-j} \\to \\cdots \\to F^0 \\to M \\to 0\\) is $0$ and \\(F^{-j} \\to \\cdots \\to F^0 \\cong M \\oplus K^{-j}[j]\\) in the derived category. So we generate $M$. &#9632; &nbsp; Lemma. The collection \\(\\mathcal O(i-n),\\ldots,\\mathcal O(i-1), \\mathcal O(i)\\) generates $D^b(\\operatorname{coh} \\mathbb{P}_k^n)$. Proof. (Expand to view) Any complex $C$ with $H^i(C) = 0$ for $i \\gg 0$ and $0 \\gg i$ is an iterated sequence of cones of the form \\(\\operatorname{cone}(H^j(C)[j+1] \\to C_{j+1})\\) where $C_m = H^m(C)[m]$ for maximal $m$ with $H^m(C) \\neq 0$. Thus, we can generate a bounded complex using its cohomology sheaves – which we generated in the last lemma. &#9632; &nbsp; To finish the proof of Beilinson’s result, we need to compute \\(\\operatorname{Ext}^l(\\mathcal O(i),\\mathcal O(j)) \\cong H^l(\\mathbb{P}^n_k, \\mathcal O(j-i))\\) We will do this next.

    "content": "The universal way to “compute” $H^i(X,\\mathcal F)$ is to . | replace $\\mathcal F$ with an injective resolution, | apply $\\Gamma(X,-)$, and | compute cohomology of the resulting complex of $k$-modules. | . Unfortunately, projective resolutions are hard enough to handle and we have some very explicit projective modules. Injective objects are generally more complicated. Having enough control over their explicit structure to compute cohomology of a sequence is a big ask. However, there is a bit more flexibility in computing derived using adapated objects . If we can construct a resolution \\(0 \\to \\mathcal F \\to \\mathcal A^0 \\to \\mathcal A^1 \\to \\cdots\\) with \\(H^i(X,\\mathcal A^j) = 0, ~\\forall i &gt; 0\\) then \\(H^i(X,\\mathcal F) \\cong H^i (\\Gamma(X,\\mathcal A^\\bullet))\\) . Recall that $\\Gamma(X,-)$ is yields an equivalence between $\\operatorname{Qcoh} X$ and $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ if $X = \\operatorname{Spec} R$. Consequently, if $\\mathcal F$ is a quasi-coherent sheaf supported on affine patch, then \\(H^i(X,\\mathcal F) = 0, ~\\forall i &gt; 0\\) for general $\\mathcal F$. For a general $\\mathcal F$ and open cover $U_1,\\ldots,U_n$ by affines, each $\\mathcal F|_{U_i}$ is adapted and we have the obvious map \\(\\mathcal F \\to \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \\mathcal F|_{U_i}\\) Since $\\mathcal F$ is a sheaf, this is injective but it is rarely surjective. To fix it and make a resolution, let \\(\\v{C}^s(\\mathcal F) := \\bigoplus_{i_0 &lt; \\cdots &lt; i_s} \\mathcal F|_{U_{i_0} \\cap \\cdots \\cap U_{i_s}}\\) and \\(\\delta^s : \\v{C}^s(\\mathcal F) \\to \\v{C}^{s+1}(\\mathcal F)\\) where the map \\(\\delta^s : F|_{U_{i_0} \\cap \\cdots \\widehat{U_{i_j}} \\cdots \\cap U_{i_s}} \\to F|_{U_{i_0} \\cap \\cdots \\cap U_{i_s}}\\) is restricting scaled by $(-1)^j$. Lemma. $\\v{C}^\\bullet(\\mathcal F)$ is a resolution. Proof. (Expand to view) It suffices to check exactness on stalks where each restriction map inducts an isomorphisms. Inclusion-exclusion says this is exact. &#9632; &nbsp; Lemma. If each $U_{i_0} \\cap \\cdots \\cap U_{i_s}$ is affine, then \\(H^i(X,\\mathcal F) \\cong H^i(\\Gamma(X,\\v{C}^\\bullet(\\mathcal F)))\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) As discussed above, we have a resolution by sheaves adapted to $\\Gamma(X,-)$. &#9632; &nbsp; It would be nice to know that given two affines $U,V$ in $X$ the intersection $U \\cap V$ is also affine. Such a scheme is called semi-separated. A separated scheme is one where the diagonal morphism is a closed immersion. This implies semi-separated. We will sidestep the generalities here because we will use very specific affines: principal opens in $\\operatorname{Proj} R$. Here the intersection is another principal open so the conditions of the previous lemma are immediate. In our example of $\\mathbb{P}_k^n$ we use the principal opens $U_{x_i}$.

You should submit a request in writing (email is acceptable) stating the dates of the anticipated absence, explaining the reason for absence, providing supporting documentation as required above, and including any request for make-up work. You should submit this request no later than the end of the second week of regularly scheduled classes in a full fall or spring semester term and within twice the length of the drop/add period for any other term. If regularly attending class becomes difficult for any reason, please contact me to discuss the issue. In accordance with university policy, a grade penalty of 10% may be imposed if a student has unexcused absensces exceeding 5% of the total number of courses. For this course, that means missing TWO courses without excuse. All absences due to documented illness or quarantine will be excused, and no grade penalty will be assessed for missing classes for this reason. If you experience COVID-19 symptoms, please stay home, contact the COVID-19 Student Health Services (SHS) nurse line (803-576-8511), complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and select the option allowing the Student Ombuds to contact your professors. When talking with the SHS nurse, be sure to ask for documentation of the consult as you will need this to document why you missed class. You will also use the COVID-19 Student Report Form if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or if you have been ordered to quarantine because of close contact with a person who was COVID-19 positive.

    "title": "COVID Policies",
    "content": "As of 8/17/2021, UofSC requires face coverings, including in this class. For more information on this semester’s COVID policies see the guidance from the Provost. I strongly encourage getting vaccinated. I encourage physical distancing. While not always possible, I will strive to keep everyone at least three feet apart, even when working in groups, which we will do regularly. If you feel uncomfortable with group work in my class, please come talk with me and I don’t mind letting you work independently at all. I have been requested to keep a seating chart. I have been urged to keep this seating chart for contact tracing purposes and will do my best to abide by the University policy. Questions You May Have . What if I get sick with COVID? Two things have to occur: Isolation: Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are released from isolation when a medical professional has determined, based on the current CDC and DHEC guidelines, that they have recovered. Currently, these guidelines include being fever-free for at least 24 hours and at least 10 days from their first symptom or positive test if they are asymptomatic. Quarantine: Unvaccinated students who are deemed a close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case will be quarantined for 7-14 days from their last contact with the infected individual. More specifically, students who test negative on day 5, 6, or 7 can leave quarantine after 7 full days; individuals who did not test but remain asymptomatic can leave after 10 full days. Individuals who are symptomatic or have other health concerns may be advised to remain under quarantine for 14 days.  . What is the attendance policy if I get COVID? In brief, I must provide make-up course work including content and assignments when students have excused absences which include (but are not limited to) being in quarantine or isolation, religious holidays, medical conditions related to pregnancy, and military duty. However, recorded classes and hybrid/online options are not required and should not be expected. All excused absences must have documentation. See syllabus for further attendance policies. How will the Dr. Ballard know if I am absent due to quarantine or isolation? COVID-19 related absences must be document through the Student Ombudsman.  Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been exposed and require quarantining should complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and instructors should request this form in order to excuse the absence.  . Can I inquire about classmates condition with COVID? Sadly, not with me. These are health issues and the information is protected by state and federal law. If an individual student has questions about whether they should quarantine or believe that they have been in close contact, have them reach out to the COVID Phone Bank (803-576-8511). Would we ever change to go online if too many people are sick? Only in the rare instance that 30% or more of students have documented excused absences may I take the course online. This is not to be expected and very complicated according to the current policies. What if Dr. Ballard gets sick with COVID? I have been fully vaccinated and breakthrough infection symptoms most often resemble the common cold. In the event of a breakthrough infection, I will enter the self-isolation period and the course will switch modality to synchronous online temporarily. In the rare circumstance I am unable to teach remotely, a substitute instructor will take over the course. ",

It will be expected that we will not attack one another personally for holding different opinions. | Do not use all CAPITAL LETTERS in emails or discussion board postings.

Additionally, make sure you reference the course number (Ex. ENGL 287) in the message and sign the mail with your name. | Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Text messaging language is not acceptable. | Use good taste when communicating.

    "content": "Matthew Ballard . ballard@math.sc.edu . Schedule an appointment . I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of South Carolina. I have been teaching mathematics for almost two decades and have guided nearly 1000 students from all levels through math courses. A mindset focused on growth is essential for learning mathematics. Each day is a small step forward. When we turn around at the end of the course, only then, do we see how far we have truly traveled. For more of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, take a look at the teaching page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at any stage. For a brief introduction to my mentees see the mentoring page. In my research, I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from Homological Mirror Symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. My research has been partially supported by the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It has also benefited from a membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, funding from UofSC, and the Southeastern Conference. For more information about me, see my CV. For a research summary and a list of my papers, take a look at my research page. I regularly organize mathematical events, even virtual ones. For the full list of events, see the organizing page. If you are interested in participating, contact me. ",
