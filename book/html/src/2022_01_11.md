# Quasi-coherent sheaves on projective varieties 

Let $R$ be a $\mathbb{N}$-graded commutative ring. 

We [constructed](https://738.f21.matthewrobertballard.com/notes/2021-12-02/) a functor 
$$
\widetilde{(-)} : \operatorname{GrMod} R \to \operatorname{Mod} X
$$ 
where $X = \operatorname{Proj} R$ and a functor in the other 
direction 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\underline{\Gamma}(X,-) : \operatorname{Mod} X & \to 
\operatorname{GrMod} R \\
\mathcal F & \mapsto \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}} \Gamma(X,\mathcal F(i))
\end{aligned}
$$

Let's think a little more about their relationsip. For any $m \in M_l$, we 
get a map 
$$
\begin{aligned}
	m : R & \to M(l) \\
	r & \mapsto rm
\end{aligned}
$$
Applying $\widetilde{(-)}$, we get a map 
$$
	\mathcal O_X \to \widetilde{M}(l) 
$$
and hence an element of $\Gamma(X,\widetilde{M}(l))$. This gives a natural 
transformation 
$$
	\eta_M : M \to \underline{\Gamma}(X,\widetilde{M})
$$

Similarly, for any $\mathcal O_X$-module $\mathcal F$, there is a 
natural transformation 
$$
\epsilon_{\mathcal F} : \widetilde{\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F)} \to \mathcal F
$$
which we describe on the principal opens $U_x$ for $x \in R_i$ 
with $i > 0$. We have 
$$
\widetilde{\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F)}(U_x) = 
(\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F)_x)_0 
$$
Each element of $(\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F)\_x)\_0$ can be written 
as 
$$
\frac{f}{x^s}
$$
where $f \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal F(si))$ and $x \in R_i$. 
Restricting to $U_x$ 
we get an element $f|_{U_x} \in \Gamma(U_x,\mathcal F(si))$. 

On $U_x$, we have an isomorphism $1/x^s : \mathcal F(is) \to 
\mathcal F$. Thus, we get an element 
$$
\frac{1}{x^s} f|_{U_x} \in \Gamma(U_x,\mathcal F)
$$
giving an element of $\mathcal F(U_x)$. 

**Proposition**. The natural transformations $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ 
induce an adjunction $\widetilde{(-)} \dashv \underline{\Gamma}$. 

{{#proof}}
Using a [theorem](https://738.f21.matthewrobertballard.com/notes/2021-08-31/) 
from last semester, we have to check that 
$$
\widetilde{M} \overset{\widetilde{\eta_M}}{\to} \widetilde{
\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{M})} \overset{\epsilon_{\widetilde{M}}}{\to}
\widetilde{M}
$$
and 
$$
\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F) \overset{\eta_{\underline{\Gamma}
(\mathcal F)}}{\to} \underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{\underline{
\Gamma}(\mathcal F)}) \overset{\underline{\Gamma}(\epsilon_{\mathcal F})}{\to} 
\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F)
$$
are both identity maps.

For the $\epsilon_{\widetilde{M}} \circ \widetilde{\eta_M}$, 
we check the map is the identity for sections over 
each principal open $U_x$. Given $m/x^i \in \widetilde{M}(U_x)$, we 
have 
$$
\widetilde{\eta_M}(m/x^i) = \frac{\eta_M(m)}{x^i}
$$
restricting $\eta_M(m)$ back to $U_x$ gives $m \in \Gamma(U_x,
\widetilde{M}(|m|))$. 

For $\underline{\Gamma}(\epsilon_{\mathcal F}) \circ 
\eta_{\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F)}$, if we take 
$f \in \Gamma(X,\mathcal F(l))$, then 
$$
\eta_{\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F)}(f) : \mathcal O \to 
\widetilde{\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F)}(l) 
$$
corresponds to global section $\widetilde{\underline{\Gamma}
(\mathcal F)}(l)$ of which is $f$ on each $U_x$. Applying 
$\underline{\Gamma}(\epsilon_{\mathcal F})$, we see we get 
$f$ back. 
{{/proof}}

Under some mild assumptions, we see that $\widetilde{(-)}$ 
hits all quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$. 

**Lemma**. If $R$ is finitely-generated in degree $1$ 
as a graded $k$-algebra and $\mathcal F$ is quasi-coherent, 
then $\epsilon_{\mathcal F}$ is an isomorphism. 

{{#proof}}
From the above, we see that $\eta_{\mathcal F}(f/x^s) = 0$ 
if and only if $f|_{U_x} = 0$. Thus, $f = 0$ away from $Z(x)$. 

Let $x_0,\ldots,x_n$ denote our generators in degree $1$. We 
have a affine cover $U_{x_j}$ and
$$
Z(x) \cap U_{x_j} = Z(x/x_j^i)
$$ 
is a hypersurface in each $U_j$. Then $M := 
\Gamma(U_{x_j},\mathcal F(is))$ 
is a $R := (R_{x_j})\_0$ module and $f \in M$. We know that 
$f = 0$ in $M_{x/x_j^i}$ so there is some $n_j$ with 
$$
\frac{x^{n_j}}{x_j^{n_j i}} f = 0 
$$
on $U_{x_j}$. Taking the max of the $n_j$, we see that there is 
some $x$ with $x^n f = 0$ on all of $X$. Thus, $f = 0$ in 
$\underline{\Gamma}(\mathcal F)\_x$ already and $\epsilon\_{\mathcal F}$ 
is injective. 

A similar argument shows that for any $s \in \Gamma(U_x,\mathcal F)$ 
there is some $n > 0$ so that $x^n s$ lifts to 
$\Gamma(X,\mathcal F(ni)$. This shows that $\epsilon_{\mathcal F}$ is 
surjective. 
{{/proof}}

Recall that for a graded $R$-module $M$, we have its 
_torsion_ submodule 
$$
\tau(M) := \lbrace m \in M \mid \exists ~n_0 > 0, 
(R_+)^n m = 0 ~\forall n \geq n_0 \rbrace
$$
and we say a $M$ is _torsion_ if
$$
\tau(M) = M 
$$
The module is _torsion-free_ if 
$$
\tau(M) = 0
$$

There is a short exact sequence 
$$
0 \to \tau(M) \to M \to M/\tau(M) \to 0
$$
Since 
$$
\widetilde{\tau(M)} = 0 
$$
there is a natural map 
$$
\alpha_M : M/\tau(M) \to \underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{M})
$$

**Lemma**. Assume $R$ is finitely-generated over $k$ in degree $1$ 
by $x\_0,\ldots,x\_n$ and that each $x\_i$ is not a zero-divisor. Then
$\alpha\_M$ is injective 

{{#proof}}
The kernel of $M \to \underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{M})$ consists 
of $m \in M$ such that $(m) = 0$ in $(M\_x)\_0$ for all homogeneous 
$x \in R_+$. 

Let $x\_0,\ldots,x\_n$ denote the generators of $R$ over $k$ in 
degree $1$. Let $m \in \operatorname{ker} \alpha_M$ be 
an element of  degree $l$. Then $m/x_i^l = 0$ 
for each $i$ and $x_i^{n_i}m = 0$ for some $n_i$. Thus, for 
large enough $n$ we have $(R_+)^n m = 0$ and so 
$m \in \operatorname{Tors}(M)$. 
{{/proof}}

We can describe $\tau(M)$ as 
$$
\tau(M) \cong \operatorname{colim}_s 
\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}(R/(R_+)^s,M)
$$
where 
$$
\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}(M,N) := 
\bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}} \operatorname{Hom}(M,N(i))
$$
is the internal Hom for graded modules. 

There are also the exact sequences 
$$
0 \to (R_+)^s \to R \to R/(R_+)^s
$$
which gives an exact sequence 
$$
0 \to \operatorname{colim}_s 
\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}(R/(R_+)^s,M) \to M \to 
\operatorname{colim}_s 
\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}((R_+)^s,M)
$$
similar to the sequence 
$$
0 \to \tau(M) \to M \to \underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{M})
$$
which leads us to compare $\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{M})$ 
and $\operatorname{colim}\_s 
\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}((R\_+)^s,M)$

Since 
$$
\cdots \to \widetilde{(R_+)^{s+1}} \to \widetilde{(R_+)^s} \to \cdots \to \widetilde{R_+} \to \widetilde{R}
$$ 
are all isomorphisms, we see that any 
$$
\phi \in \operatorname{colim} \operatorname{Hom}
((R_+)^s,M(l))
$$
induces a well-defined 
$$
\widetilde{\phi} : \mathcal O \to \widetilde{M}(l)
$$
and hence an element of $\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{M})$. 

Let's denote this map by 
$$
\beta_M : \operatorname{colim}_s 
\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}((R_+)^s,M) \to 
\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{M})
$$

**Lemma**. Assume that $R$ is finitely-generated over $k$ by 
elements of degree $1$. Then 
$\beta_M$ is an isomorphism for all $M$. 

{{#proof}}
An element of $\Gamma(X,\widetilde{M}(l))$ 
is a collection of homogeneous elements $m_f \in M$ 
for each homogeneous $f \in R_+$ so that 
- there is $s_f$ 
such that $m_f/f^{s_f}$ has degree $l$ and 
- for any $f,g$
$$
\frac{m_f}{f^{s_f}} = \frac{m_g}{g^{s_g}}
$$
in $M_{fg}$. 

Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ denote a set of homogeneous generators 
for $R$ over $k$. We claim that the function $\phi$ which assigns 
$\phi(x_i^{s_i}) = m_{x_i}$ extends to a well-defined module 
map $(R_+)^s \to M(l)$ for some $s$. This gives the inverse 
to $\beta_M$. 

Let's check that this construction yields a well-defined 
homomorphism. Up to replacing $m_i$ with $x_i^{l_i}$ and $s_i$ 
with $s_i+l_i$, we can assume that 
$$
m_i = \frac{x_i^{s_i}}{x_j^{s_j}}m_j
$$
in $M_{x_j}$. If we have a relation of the form 
$$
a_1x_1^{s_1} + \cdots + a_n x_n^{s_n} = 0
$$
then in $M_{x_i}$ we have 
$$
\begin{aligned}
a_1 m_1 + \cdots a_n m_n & = 
a_1 \frac{x_1^{s_1}}{x_i^{s_i}}m_i + \cdots +
a_n \frac{x_1^{s_1}}{x_i^{s_i}}m_i \\ 
& = \frac{m_i}{x_i^{s_i}} \left( a_1 x_1^{s_1} + \cdots + 
a_n x_n^{s_n} \right) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$
Thus, $a_1 m_1 + \cdots + a_n m_n$ is annihilated by some 
power of each $x_i$. Passing to a sufficient high power of 
$R_+$ forces this to vanish. 
{{/proof}}

As a corollary, we get short exact sequences. 

**Corollary**. Assume that $R$ is finitely-generated by 
elements of degree $1$ over $k$. Then, for each injective 
graded $R$-module $I$ we have a short exact sequence 
$$
0 \to \tau(I) \to I \to \underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{I}) \to 0
$$

{{#proof}}
Since $I$ is injective, we get short exact sequences 
$$
0 \to \operatorname{Hom}(R/(R_+)^s,I(l)) \to I_l \to 
\operatorname{Hom}((R_+)^s,I(l)) \to 0
$$
taking direct sums and passing to the colimit gives the result. 
{{/proof}}
 
Note the map $M \to \underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{M})$ is not 
always onto. 

**Example**. Take $k[x]$ with $|x| = 1$. Then, 
$$
\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{k[x]}) = k[x,x^{-1}]
$$

As consequence, we get a semi-orthogonal decomposition 
relating graded $R$-modules and quasi-coherent sheaves on 
$\operatorname{Proj} R$. 

**Proposition**. Assume that $R$ is finitely-generated by 
elements of degree $1$ over $k$. Then there are 
semi-orthogonal decompositions
$$
D^\dagger(\operatorname{GrMod} R) = \langle 
D^\dagger(\operatorname{GrMod}_{\operatorname{Tors}} R), 
D^\dagger(\operatorname{Qcoh} \operatorname{Proj} R) \rangle
$$
where $\dagger \in \lbrace b,+,-,\emptyset \rbrace$. 

Here $\operatorname{GrMod}_{\operatorname{Tors}} R$ denotes the 
abelian subcategory of torsion graded $R$-modules.

{{#proof}}
For each complex of injectives $I$, we have a short exact 
sequence of complexes 
$$
0 \to \tau(I) \to I \to \underline{\Gamma}
(\widetilde{I}^\bullet) \to 0
$$
and thus a triangle 
$$
\tau(I) \to I \to \underline{\Gamma}
(\widetilde{I}^\bullet) \to \tau(I)[1]
$$
Each component of $\tau(I)$ is torsion. 

Thanks to adjunction we have 
$$
\operatorname{Hom}(\tau(I),\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{J})) 
\cong \operatorname{Hom}(\widetilde{\tau(I)}, \widetilde{J}) = 0
$$
so we have semi-orthogonality. 

It remains to check that $\underline{\Gamma}$ is fully-faithful 
and the derived functors of $\tau$ and $\underline{\Gamma}$ 
preserve cohomological boundedness. 

Using adjunction, we have 
$$
\operatorname{Hom}(\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{I}),
\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{J})) \cong 
\operatorname{Hom}(\widetilde{I},
\widetilde{\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{J})}) 
$$
And
$$
\operatorname{Hom}(\widetilde{I},
\widetilde{\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{J})}) \cong 
\operatorname{Hom}(\widetilde{I},
\widetilde{J})
$$
since 
$$
\widetilde{\underline{\Gamma}(\widetilde{J})} \to \widetilde{J}
$$
is an isomorphism. 

Finally, from the triangle we see that $\mathbf{R}^i\tau = 0$ for 
$i \gg 0$ if and only if $\mathbf{R}^i \underline{\Gamma} = 0$ 
for $i \gg 0$. We will see 
[next]({% link notes/2022_01_13.md %}) that 
$\mathbf{R}^i \underline{\Gamma} = 0$ for $i > N$ where $N$ 
is the number of generators of $R$ over $k$.

**Remark**. 
- One can remove the condition that the finite set 
of generators of $R$ are of degree $1$ if we work with 
the _quotient stack_ $[U/\mathbb{G}\_m]$ with the quasi-affine $U = 
\operatorname{Spec} R \setminus \lbrace R_+ \rbrace$ instead of 
$\operatorname{Proj} R$. 
- One would like to replace $\operatorname{GrMod}$ and 
$\operatorname{Qcoh}$ with their finite versions 
$\operatorname{grmod}$ and $\operatorname{coh}$. This can be 
done but one needs to 
[truncate the grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0503632).
